# Wifi-to-Router

## This code will allow you to connect your ESP32 to Wifi. When you click a button (set up on GPIO 0 -> GND), you will create a wifi hotspot to the ESP32. When connected, you will get a popup that will ask for your wifi router credentials. After putting them in, you should be connected to the router. Click the button to reset the wifi.
